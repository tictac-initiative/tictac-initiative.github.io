          The <strong>Taxonomy of ICT sCalability and replicabiliTy Analyses - Collaborative Initiative (TICTA-C Initiative)</strong> is an open-source web initiative by researchers from the <strong>Institute for Research in Technology of the Comillas Pontifical University</strong> (Madrid, Spain).<br><br>
          <strong>TICTA-C</strong> presents a taxonomy of the literature that has conducted studies (quantitative and/or qualitative) on the scalability, replicability, or performance of information and communication technologies (ICT) in smart grids and smart cities contexts. <br><br>
          The <a href="https://tictac-initiative.github.io/UseCases.html">taxonomy</a> is visually presented as a scheme, classifying easch reference according to the use case under study. Furthemore, the metrics used in quantitative and qualitative analyses are classified depending on whether they have been applied to study wired or wireless technologies. <br><br>
          This initiative is developed to promote the sharing of knowledge about the scalability and replicability of ICT systems, to facilitate and support the replication and implementation of smart solutions. <br><br>
          If you would like to include a reference to the taxonomy, please, fill in this simple <a href="https://tictac-initiative.github.io/form.html">form</a>.
